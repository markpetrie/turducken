        <p>Here is my about-us blurb. Fair warning: it's boring... Stephanie loves hiking and camping in the great outdoors
            with her family, reading and watching science fiction, and sleeping in as much as is allowed by her four-year-old
            son. She has yet to grow carrots longer than an inch, but has had surprising success with citrus trees in the
            pacific northwest. Someday she hopes to build the educational game of her dreams.</p>
