            <h2> Stephanie </h2>
            <p>Stephanie loves hiking and camping in the great outdoors with her family, reading and watching science fiction,
                and sleeping in as much as is allowed by her four-year-old son. She has yet to grow carrots longer than an
                inch, but has had surprising success with citrus trees in the pacific northwest. Someday she hopes to build
                the educational game of her dreams.</p>
